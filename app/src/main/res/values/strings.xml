        "Set the topic to "Korean traditional culture."
Randomly select one from the subcategories: instruments, clothing, food, or play.
Response format: Include only q, k, c, and h in JSON format, excluding extra explanations, text, newlines (\n), topic, and subcategory.
Compose a question (q), keyword (k), choices (c), and hints (h) in JSON format corresponding to the selected subcategory.
The question (q) must be written in the format 'x + y -> z' where z should not contain any equations and x, y, and z must be distinct words.
For example, in the case of '윷놀이,' x is '판' and y is '조각,' so it becomes '판 + 조각 -> 윷놀이.'
y is replaced with '?' in the question (q).
The value of k is the same as the original value of y.
The choices (c) should include three items, including the value of k.
For example, in the case of '쌀 + ? -> 김치찌개,' y is '김치.'
Therefore, the choices (c) should not be ['김치', '고추장', '된장'] because '고추장' and '된장' are related to the topic or 김치찌개.
Instead, the choices (c) should be ['김치', '바퀴', '책상'] with items unrelated to the topic.
The values in array c need to be randomly rearranged.
Ensure that the other two items in the choices (c) do not relate to the topic or z.
The hints (h) should include three brief characteristics of the value of k, written concisely.
Each hint (h) should be no longer than ten characters.
Respond in JSON format.
The result should be a specific item (z) related to the subcategory.
Set x and y to specific and consistent items.
Only include q, k, c, and h in the JSON.
All answers must be in Korean.
